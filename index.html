				<p>
				Tor sees use by <a href="https://2019.www.torproject.org/about/torusers">many
				important segments of the population</a>, including whistle blowers,
				journalists, Chinese dissidents skirting the Great Firewall and oppressive
				censorship, abuse victims, stalker targets, the US military, and law
				enforcement, just to name a few.  While Tor is not designed for malicious
				computer users, it is true that they can use the network for malicious ends.
				In reality however, the actual amount of <a
				href="https://support.torproject.org/abuse/">abuse</a> is quite low. This
				is largely because criminals and hackers have significantly better access to
				privacy and anonymity than do the regular users whom they prey upon. Criminals
				can and do <a
				href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200131013910/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_tools.html">build,
				sell, and trade</a> far larger and <a
				href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200131013908/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/08/web_fraud_20_distributing_your.html">more
				powerful networks</a> than Tor on a daily basis. Thus, in the mind of this
				operator, the social need for easily accessible censorship-resistant private,
				anonymous communication trumps the risk of unskilled bad actors, who are
				almost always more easily uncovered by traditional police work than by
				extensive monitoring and surveillance anyway.</p>

				<p>
				In terms of applicable law, the best way to understand Tor is to consider it a
				network of routers operating as common carriers, much like the Internet
				backbone. However, unlike the Internet backbone routers, Tor routers
				explicitly do not contain identifiable routing information about the source of
				a packet, and no single Tor node can determine both the origin and destination
				of a given transmission.</p>

				<p>
				As such, there is little the operator of this router can do to help you track
				the connection further. This router maintains no logs of any of the Tor
				traffic, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or
				illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other).  Attempts to
				seize this router will accomplish nothing.</p>

				<!-- FIXME: US-Only section. Remove if you are a non-US operator -->

				<p>
				Furthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that
				its contents are further protected under the ECPA. <a
				href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2707">18
				USC 2707</a> explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account
				<i>plus</i>  legal fees)
				in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it
				should be clear at this point that traffic with an originating IP address of
				FIXME_DNS_NAME should not constitute probable cause to seize the
				machine). Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this
				machine.</p>

				<!-- FIXME: May or may not be US-only. Some non-US tor nodes have in
				     fact reported DMCA harassment... -->

				<p>
				If you are a representative of a company who feels that this router is being
				used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or
				contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure
				maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their
				equipment, in accordance with <a
				href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512">DMCA
				"safe harbor" provisions</a>. In other words, you will have just as much luck
				sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers. Please consult
				<a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/eff-tor-legal-faq/tor-dmca-response/">EFF's prepared
				response</a> for more information on this matter.</p>

				<p>For more information, please consult the following documentation:</p>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<p>
				That being said, if you still have a complaint about the router,  you may
				email the <a href="mailto:FIXME_YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS">maintainer</a>. If
				complaints are related to a particular service that is being abused, I will
				consider removing that service from my exit policy, which would prevent my
				router from allowing that traffic to exit through it. I can only do this on an
				IP+destination port basis, however. Common P2P ports are
				already blocked.</p>

				<p>
				You also have the option of blocking this IP address and others on
				the Tor network if you so desire. The Tor project provides a <a
				href="https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist">web service</a>
				to fetch a list of all IP addresses of Tor exit nodes that allow exiting to a
				specified IP:port combination, and an official <a
				href="https://dist.torproject.org/tordnsel/">DNSRBL</a> is also available to
				determine if a given IP address is actually a Tor exit server. Please
				be considerate
				when using these options. It would be unfortunate to deny all Tor users access
				to your site indefinitely simply because of a few bad apples.</p>
